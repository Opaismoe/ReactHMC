    name: "Scottish Fold",
    summary: "The Scottish Fold is identified by its folded ears, although not every cat in the breed has them. In fact, because of the genetic qualities that cause the folded ears, two folded-eared cats should never be bred together as the kittens could suffer health problems. That said, correctly bred Scottish Fold cats and kittens are perfectly cute and healthy!",

Ken McGill, the show's judge, asked for one for breeding purposes",
